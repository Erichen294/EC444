Summary: My getDataPointsFromCSV() function reads data from the csv file and parses it. Depending on which company the entry it, I will create a new entry and push it to the correct array. The chart will be populated with each company and the x and y axis will be lableled. The title is "Stocks over Time". The html file is full of scripts that does the reading and creating the chart.
