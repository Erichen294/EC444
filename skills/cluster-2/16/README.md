Summary: I recreated the circuit for my photocell and flashed the c program that reads the voltage detected by the photocell and prints it to the serial port. I wrote a node.js program that reads from the serial port and prints out data to the console. As I am reading data from the serial port, I'm appending it to the "sensor_data.csv" file in a sensor-time pair per line.
