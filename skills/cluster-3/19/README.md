Summary: We made a free account on dynu and created a domain name called "squigglies.loseyourip.com". We also created a node.js program that would make one of our computers a http server. We connected that computer to the router and made the ext port number 8081 and the int port number 8080 since that's what the server is listening for. Then we put the ip address of the server into the port forwarding list. Now we can access the website from our phones and computers even if we're not connected to the Group_1 wifi.
