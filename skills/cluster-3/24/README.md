Summary: We wrote code to make the node program act like a server and it sends the client (esp32) a blink duration variable and the esp blinks the onboard gpio led for that set amount of time. The second version of the code makes the esp act like the server and the node program (client) sends a number (1) to the server which tells the esp to turn on the onboard gpio pin.
