Summary:
I wrote a program that polled the state of the push button and cycles through the LEDs in order from red to green to yellow to blue and cycling around. I used the same circuit as skill 11. For the second program, I modified the first program to implement hardware interrupts. This makes it so that the hardware becomes edge triggered instead of level triggered.
