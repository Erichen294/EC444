Summary: I used the example uart echo code and flashed it onto the esp32. If you enter a number it will echo it back and if you print a string it will echo the string back. For the next programming part, I wrote a program that has 3 modes. The first mode is a toggle mode where the onboard led toggles on/off depending if the user inputs 't'. The second mode is a echo mode where the monitor will echo what the user types if the length of the word is at least two letters. The third mode is a hex mode where the monitor will echo the integer that the user inputs, but converted to hexadecimal. The max integer is 4095 since the max number is 12 bits long.
