Summary: I built the circuit using a voltage divider with the photocell and a 10kohm resistor. I am using A2 for the ADC pin. The code is 
essentially the same as skill 7 except with a 2 second sampling rate. If I cover the photocell with my finger, the voltage reading drops to 
around 500-600 mV and if I shine a flashlight on the photocell it'll spike to 2800 mV. The voltage reading in the room is about 2200 mV.
