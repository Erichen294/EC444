Summary: I created a state diagram for the whack-a-mole game. Then, I created a state table for the diagram and coded up some pseudo-code representing the state table. The dashes in the state diagram means error-handling because it represents a situation where the event should not happen for the specific state. The rand event represents a random generation for generating the next number of moles. For simplification purposes, I am only representing three spots in the whack-a-mole game. A one means that a mole will appear in that spot and a zero means that a mole won't. However, this state table is easily expandable to any number of moles.
