Summary: The count variable increments every time the sensor detects a color change from white to black or vice versa. Initially when the while loop is entered, a timer is started and every time one revolution is finished the timer is stopped and the amount of time it takes to make that one revolution is measured. From there the wheel speed is able to be calculated since we can divide the wheel circumference by the time it took to make one revolution. The timer is reset to zero after the calculation is done and the cycle repeats.
