Summary:
We printed an encoder pattern scaled to 30%, so that it would fit on the buggy wheel. Then, we wired up the LED/photosensor pair to the breadboard and had the sensor facing the encoder pattern. Everytime the sensor detects a change from a white strip to a black strip or vice versa it will increment a count variable. Assuming that a count of 12 implies one wheel revolution we were able to calculate the wheel rpm and therefore the wheel speed.
