Summary: I created a circuit with the ultrasonic sensor. The trigger pin is connected to A1 and the echo pin is connected to A0. The sensor correctly outputs the distance the sensor is from the object. The further I move away from the object that is reflecting the sound then the output increases and vice versa.
