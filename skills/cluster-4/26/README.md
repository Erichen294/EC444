Summary: We wired up the ESC, steering servo, battery and esp to the buggy. We also wrote a program that controls the buggy. W makes it go forward, S makes it go backwards, A makes it turn left, and B makes it turn right. Whenever we want to go backwards, we must get a negative angle then go to zero then back to the negative angle.
