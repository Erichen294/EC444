Summary: I created a three led circuit connected with an ultrasonic sensor. The program reads the distance measured by the ultrasonic sensor and compares it to the setpoint of 50 cm. The red led will turn on if the difference between the setpoint and the current distance is negative, the  green led will turn on if it is within 0.5 cm of 50 cm, and the blue led will turn on if the difference is positive.
